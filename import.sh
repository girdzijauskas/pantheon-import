#!/bin/bash


# Usage: sh import.sh site-name "Site Label" "databasename.sql"
# $1 = machine name of the site on Pantheon (unique, and the same as the folder that will be created)
# $2 = label of the site on Pantheon
# $3 = the name of the database file that is going to be imported


# Before running the script, you need:

# 1. A modified .gitignore file in the same directory as where you're running the script from

# 2. A composer-edits.php script file that edits the composer.json file to remove some of the pieces

# 3. You will also need to go the database in the cPanel backup file, open it, and 
# make sure that the import happens to a database named 'pantheon' rather than
# one that is named after the sql file. Lines to edit:
#
# -- Current Database: `pantheon`
# CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ `pantheon` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 */;
# USE `pantheon`;

# 4. Renamed the cPanel backup folder to $1-backup. Example: site machine name is
# lmba, cPanel backup folder name: lmba-backup

# 5. Have both composer and terminus installed and working, as well as made the 
# authentication between your terminus command line and the Pantheon platform 
# @see https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/install

# 6. This script, .gitignore and composer-edits.php in the parent folder of where your projects will be
# living. For me, this is User/work/3-projects/. A created project will live in
# User/work/3-projects/lmba and this script lives in User/work/3-projects/import.sh.
